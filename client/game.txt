🧪 Witch’s Brew: War for the Cauldron

(Strategy + Open-World Foraging + Shop Management)

🎯 Core Loop

Explore world → Gather ingredients → Survive human raids → Brew potions → Supply monsters → Upgrade & expand territory

This gives you two gameplay layers that feed each other:

Exploration (risk) — go outside, gather ingredients, dodge humans

Shop management (reward) — brew and sell potions to demons, zombies, vampires

🕹️ Gameplay Structure
🌙 1. The Day/Night Cycle

Day: Manage shop — brew, sell, research, upgrade cauldrons, serve customers.

Night: Venture into the forest/swamp/cemetery to gather ingredients. Humans patrol at night — it’s risky but more resources appear.

Each in-game day lasts a few minutes → 7-day campaign.

🧺 2. Open-World Ingredient Gathering

Movement: Top-down 2D or side-scrolling (Phaser.js, Godot, or Unity WebGL).

Each biome (graveyard, swamp, cursed woods) has unique ingredients:

Grave Dust → used in defense potions.

Mandrake Root → high value, but screams attract humans.

Bat Wings, Ghost Mushrooms, Wyrm Scales, etc.

Twist:
Humans hunt monsters. If they catch you, you lose half your collected ingredients (risk–reward mechanic).

You can:

Stealth: hide behind trees, use invisibility potions.

Fight back: limited spells or bombs.

Escape: make it back to your hut safely = keep your loot.

🧪 3. Brewing & Crafting

Combine ingredients to brew potions with attributes:

Healing (restore demon HP)

Rage (boost zombie attack)

Smoke Bombs (used in foraging to evade humans)

Brewing takes time — you can multitask or upgrade cauldrons.

Higher-tier potions require rare ingredients (riskier zones).

Chance of failure (burnt potion) based on:

Tool quality

Moon phase

Player fatigue

🧛‍♂️ 4. Monster Customers (Shop Management)

Demons, zombies, and vampires line up with requests like:

“We need 10 Rage Potions for tonight’s raid.”

“Healing potions for my wounded pack.”

Each faction’s satisfaction affects:

Reputation (who visits you next)

Prices (premium if they trust you)

Story progression (unlock new quests)

Dynamic relationship system:
Helping vampires too much might anger zombies — forces strategic alignment.

⚙️ 5. Upgrades & Progression

Spend profits to improve:

Cauldrons: faster, safer brewing

Foraging tools: night vision, broom upgrades

Defenses: traps or barriers around the hut

Research: new recipes or stronger effects

You can also recruit familiars (crow scouts, cat thief) to assist with gathering or shopkeeping.

🔮 6. The Human Threat (Endgame Loop)

Humans escalate their attacks each night.
Eventually, they’ll try to raid your hut directly — turning your shop management phase into a defense mini-game.

Victory condition:
Survive 7 days and brew the Eclipse Elixir — a massive potion that ends the war (or turns the world to eternal night).

It’s Harvest Moon meets Don’t Starve meets Potionomics, with a dark, humorous Halloween spin.
